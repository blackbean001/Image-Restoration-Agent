Insights: Based on the provided data, denoising before brightening results in a lower total fail rate (31%) compared to brightening before denoising (38%). This suggests that denoising first helps in preserving image details and reducing noise, which could be amplified if brightening were done first. Therefore, the optimal order for addressing the degradations of noise and darkness in the image is to perform denoising followed by brightening.

Insights: Based on the provided data, denoising before brightening results in a lower total fail rate (31%) compared to brightening before denoising (38%). This suggests that denoising first helps in reducing noise levels effectively, which is crucial as brightening can amplify existing noise, making it more visible and harder to clean afterward. Therefore, the optimal order for addressing the degradations in the image would be to denoise first and then brighten.
